// The usage turnstile, wired directly.
//
// emo, redact and shapes never write this: they depend on desert-ant-core's
// `Inference`, which depends on `Usage` and wraps every session it builds in a
// `TrackedSession`, so there is no untracked path. This model has no inference
// runtime — a detection is arithmetic, not a Core ML or LiteRT session — so there
// is no session factory to hook, and the client is opened here instead.
//
// Same guarantees, reached differently: one turnstile per `Tongue`, opened on
// construction, a call recorded per `detect`, and a debounced flush that coalesces
// a burst of keystrokes into one send. The state machine, storage keys and wire
// format all come from core's `Usage`, so a device counts identically however it
// reached the endpoint.
//
// The Kotlin and JavaScript SDKs cannot share this file — they are direct ports
// with no Swift underneath, unlike emo's JNI and native bridges — so each carries
// its own port of the same state machine. docs/USAGE.md is the reference.
